# HBNU-CS-CODESET

English | [中文](README_CN.md)

## Introduction

This is a repository for myself and many other HBNUers.

In this repository, I will upload some of my own code, some code from my classmates(credited), and some code that I think is useful.

This repository was created on June, 2024 when I was a junior student in HBNU. It was only 1 year before I graduated from HBNU. It suddenly occurred to me that I should leave something for myself, to memorize every homework, every project, every practice, and every exam I have done in HBNU.

I always recall the days when I was a freshman, I was so excited to learn programming, and I was so eager to write code. I was so happy to solve problems, and I was so proud of myself when I finished some projects. I was so grateful to my teachers, my classmates, and my friends. I was so lucky to have the opportunity to study in HBNU.

So I decided to create this repository, to record my growth, to record my progress, to record my happiness, and to recall my memories by every line of code.

## Repo Structure & Navigation

This repo is separated into 4 folders, representing 4 years in HBNU:

- [`freshman`](./freshman_year/) - Freshman year
- [`sophomore`](./sophomore_year/) - Sophomore year
- [`junior`](./junior_year/) - Junior year
- [`senior`](./senior_year/) - Senior year

## Credits

Some of the code source files were lost from my computer, so I asked some of my classmates to provide me with their code. I will credit them here:
